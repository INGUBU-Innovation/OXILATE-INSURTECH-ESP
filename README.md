# OXILATE-INSURTECH-ESP

To be updated. This is the site for the public available results for OXILATE project, for the Spanish consortium. It contains the contributions from SII CONCATEL and TyP, focused in insurtech use case.

# The motivation

TyP and SII CONCATEL have focused on the use case: "Improved services and tools that support the Smart Insurtech lifecycle".  Insuretech, is created after joining the words: insurance and technology. Insurtech or Insuretech, are the associated words to refer to this term, although Insuretech is used much less frequently.

Insurtech, in a very summarized form[[1]](#_ftn1), is a term that refers to the concept or the ability to apply the potential of all the new technologies to the insurance sector.

These digital technologies make it possible to bring greater quality and efficiency to the insurance industry. They enable greater traceability, scalability, data quality and security, which is essential for the industry.

The use case that TyP and SII CONCATEL have worked on, called "Service enhancements and tools that support the Smart Insurtech lifecycle", aims to provide insurance companies with new methods and services to a market characterized by constantly changing consumer patterns.

The Insuretech context, like the other industries targeted by the project, faces the challenges outlined in OXILATE:

- Increased complexity due to dynamic business models.

- Need to evolve. 

- Impact of globalization and new scenario associated with new data access technologies.

As reflected in the "Cognizant Perspectives"[[2]](#_ftn2) series of articles, the insurance industry faces an added challenge: a large part of its workforce will retire in the coming years.

In addition, a recent study by Oxford Economics[[3]](#_ftn3), established that more than 83% of insurance executives rely on consultants and temporary workers to respond to market demand. TYP, through the generation of expert knowledge from the entire life cycle of products and services and the provision of improved tools to professionals in its different business units, seeks to facilitate:

- Respond to the needs of including inexperienced workforce.

- Development of new products and services.

- Solve complex challenges at a lower cost.

- Create a better value proposition.

One way to meet this challenge is through techniques that enable "Collective Intelligence" techniques. This is where OXILATE, and the research and development activities provided by TYP and SII CONCATEL  in the domains of Knowledge Graphs combined with Machine Learning techniques will make the difference.

By enabling CI techniques based on ML techniques, allowing the inclusion of expert knowledge, companies in the insurance sector will be able to enable a larger number of workers to execute specialized functions in less time and create predictive models applicable to different aspects and/or business units (risks, new products, cancellation rates...).

OXILATE will be a meeting point for customers and industry professionals, and will connect companies to new technologies, providing professionals with intelligent tools that support them throughout the product lifecycle.

For the definition of the use case, during this first milestone, different meetings have been held with key entities of the sector, to first understand -and then generalize- the context of the sector. In order to speed up and dynamize the meetings with users and interested entities, a presentation has been generated, which has facilitated the involvement of different users in the definition of requirements.

After defining the use case, it was decided to define OXILATE as the ALEXA FOR COMPANIES, in order to facilitate the assimilation of the concept by those initial target companies in the insurance sector immersed in the initial stages of digital transformation, which understand that they must evolve, but have not assimilated the benefits of new technologies and concepts. An assistant to help these companies leverage their knowledge and meet talent gaps by reducing overhead, bolstering performance and ensuring rapid adaptation to emerging market demands to shorten development lifecycles.
